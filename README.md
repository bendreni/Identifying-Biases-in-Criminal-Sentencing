# Identifying-Biases-in-Criminal-Sentencing

## Overview
This project investigates biases in the court system and criminal sentencing by analyzing a dataset containing information about defendants from the year 2018 to 2019. We aim to identify disparities in sentencing outcomes for individuals of different races, citizenship statuses, and other demographic factors.

## Project Structure
- `Code`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook used for data analysis and modeling.
- `Data`: Includes the original dataset in CSV format and any data preprocessing scripts or notebooks.
- `Reports`: Contains the project report, executive summary, and any other analysis reports.

## Project Description
- **Executive Summary**: Provides a concise overview of the project's goals, findings, and limitations.
- **Introduction**: Outlines the motivation behind the project, focusing on identifying potential biases in sentencing outcomes.
- **Data Description**: Details the dataset used in the analysis, including the relevant features and their significance.
- **Data Extraction**: Describes how the data was obtained, converted, and imported for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Shows visualizations used to understand the relationships between variables.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Discusses the ethical implications of using biased data and the limitations of the analysis.
- **Method**: Explains the regression models utilized and the rationale behind model selection.
- **Limitations**: Acknowledges the limitations of the project, including data biases and model constraints.
- **Results**: Provides insights obtained from regression models and data visualizations.
- **Discussion**: Interprets the results, highlights biases observed, and proposes future implications.
- **Takeaways and Future Implications**: Summarizes key findings and proposes further steps for research.

## Code
### Data Preprocessing
- `data_preprocessing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering steps.

### Modeling
- `modeling.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing multiple regression models and visualizations of coefficients.

### Visualizations
- `visualizations.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook showcasing data visualizations used for insights.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Explore the Jupyter Notebooks in the `Code` directory for detailed analysis steps.

## Ethical Considerations
- The dataset used in this project inherently contains biases and should not be used for predictive purposes due to ethical concerns.
- Any conclusions drawn should be viewed in the context of highlighting biases rather than making predictions.

## Future Work
- Implementing advanced machine learning models (e.g., random forest classifiers) for improved feature importance analysis.
- Exploring datasets with more comprehensive variables to understand their impact on sentencing outcomes.
